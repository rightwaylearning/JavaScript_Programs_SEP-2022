    <h1>SHRI MAHAKAL</h1>
    <h2>Ujjain Niwasi</h2>
    <p>
        <space>When Bharthari was king of 'Ujjayani' (modern-day Ujjain) in his state there lived a Brahman who after
            years of austerities was given the fruit of immortality from the celestial tree of Kalpavriksha.
            The Brahman presented the same to his monarch, Raja Bharthari, who in turn, passed it on to his love, the
            beautiful, Pinglah Rani or Ananga Sena Raja Bhartrhari's last and youngest wife.
            The queen, being in love with the Head police officer of the state, Mahipaala, presented the fruit to him,
            who further passed it on to his beloved, Lakha, one of the maids of honour. Eventually, Lakha being in love
            with the king presented the fruit back to the king.
            Having completed the circle, the fruit revealed the downsides of infidelity to the king, he summoned the
            queen and ordered her beheading, and ate the fruit himself. After that, he abdicated the throne, and became
            a religious mendicant.</space>
