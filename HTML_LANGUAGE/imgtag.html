    <h3><u>Hanuman in Ramayana</u></h3>
    <p>Evidence of devotional worship to <b>Hanuman</b> is largely absent in these texts, as well as in most archeological sites. According to Philip Lutgendorf, an American Indologist, the theological significance of <b>Hanuman</b> and devotional dedication to him emerged about 1,000 years after the composition of the Ramayana, in the 2nd millennium CE, after the arrival of Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent.[10] Lutgendorf also writes that the skills in Hanuman's resume also seem to derive in part from his windy patrimony, reflecting Vayu's role in both body and cosmos.[11] Bhakti movement saints such as Samarth Ramdas have positioned <b>Hanuman</b> as a symbol of nationalism and resistance to persecution.[12] The Vaishnava saint Madhava said that whenever Vishnu incarnates on earth, Vayu accompanies him and aids his work of preserving dharma.[13] In the modern era, Hanuman's iconography and temples have been increasingly common.[14] He is viewed as the ideal combination of "strength, heroic initiative and assertive excellence" and "loving, emotional devotion to his personal god Rama", as Shakti and Bhakti.[15] In later literature, he is sometimes portrayed as the patron god of martial arts such as wrestling and acrobatics, as well as activities such as meditation and diligent scholarship.[2] He symbolises the human excellences of inner self-control, faith, and service to a cause, hidden behind the first impressions of a being who looks like a Vanara.[14][16][17] <b>Hanuman</b> is considered to be a bachelor and an exemplary celibate</p>
