var b= 200;  // 1
// G , F
let a = 100; // 2
// G, F, B
const c = 300;
//c =400;
//  G, F, B

// cost & let both are same only diff is const type variable u cant assign agian once u done that is final



// Q>> tell me diff between var, let & const

const hh = 100;

{
  const kk = 200;   
}

// here we can't access kk , he have block scope
